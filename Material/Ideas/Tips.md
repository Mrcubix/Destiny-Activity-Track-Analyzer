# Frontend

## To not be done

- try not to clog the Interface too much

## To be done

- Find a designer to get insight on how to make this interface look good 
- Find a way to make it intuitive to use

(Both can be inspired from other interfaces)
(Need to take into account the possibility that this will be release on web & Android (Fuck iOS))
